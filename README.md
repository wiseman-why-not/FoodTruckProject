## Food Trucks Project

#### Week 3 Homework project for Skills Distillery

### Overview

 + Created a Food Truck application that ask the user for a list of food trucks.
   Then displays a menu for the food truck applications that gives the user
   data about the food truck they inputed.

### Topics/Technologies Used

+ Java
+ encapsulation
+ Objects
+ Do-while loop, switch, forEach
+ Arrays 
+ Using eclipse to create getters, setters, toString, constructors.


### Lesson Learned

+ When creating an class of an objects, create methods and fields that describe the object.
  Name, food type, food truck rating. not a method like get average.
+ When running your application in main, create methods that do something with the object that you created (foodtruck). Like get average method that takes an array of food trucks and prints out the average rating 
of all food trucks

+ creating a field of Scanner in the Class but not in the main method, will give it access throughout the class.
same with creating an array of food truck as a field since we know how large the array will be. it will give us access throughout the class.
+ Still getting practice with creating objects and using encapsulation properly.
